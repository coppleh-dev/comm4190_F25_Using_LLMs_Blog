    "I'm studying abroad in Cape Town, South Africa next semester, so I need new ideas of things to do and where is best to explore. So, today I want to see if GPT-40 and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash can plan my dream vacation in South Africa so I know all the spots to hit and where is best to explore. I also want GPT-40 and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash to make it specific to me, so I am making sure to list important factors about me, interests, and hobbies. I am interested in seeing the differences between the two GPTs and how they respond differently. "

    "Analysis: I think, overall, GPT-40 made a great itinerary and tailored the schedule well to a 20 year old college student. I will say, some of the activities are quite vague. FOr example, there are no specific hotel reccomendations. I do appreciate the specificity of the transportation such as Citibike/cable cars, which have studets discounts.
