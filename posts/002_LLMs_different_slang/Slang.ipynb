    "\n",
    "I am interested in interpreting how LLMs (GPT-40) interpet slang. In other words, when prompted speak like a \"girl\" or speak like a \"boy\" I wonder how the two would be different. I also wonder how LLMs will interpret me saying speak like a \"New Yorker\" vs speak like a \"Bostonian.\" I will prompt GPT-40 to describe to me how to make pizza using slang from these different \"types\" of people."

    "Answer: Hey there! ‚ù§Ô∏è Ready to make the cutest pizza ever? Let‚Äôs go!\n",
    "What You Need:\n",
    "Dough: Homemade or store-bought‚Äîwhatever makes life easier.\n",
    "Sauce: Something tomato-y and delicious.\n",
    "Cheese: Mozzarella is a must, but a cheese party never hurt anyone.\n",
    "Toppings: Go wild‚Äîpepperoni, veggies, pineapple, you name it!\n",
    "Let‚Äôs Do This:\n",
    "Roll It Out: Dust some flour, and roll that dough! Try a heart shape for some extra cuteness.\n",
    "Sauce Time: Spread that yummy sauce on, leaving a little border for the crust. Think of it as painting‚Äîget creative!\n",
    "Say Cheese: Load on the cheese. Maybe make fun shapes or spell something out!\n",
    "Top It Off: Time to party with the toppings. Make a smiley face or a cute pattern. Go artsy!\n",
    "Bake with Love: Pop it in the oven at 475¬∞F (245¬∞C) for about 10-15 mins until it's golden and bubbly.\n",
    "Finishing Touch: Add some fresh herbs or a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a little zing!\n",
    "Don‚Äôt Forget:\n",
    "Chill Vibes: Crank up your fave tunes. Dance around a bit; it‚Äôs a pizza party!\n",
    "Share the Love: Invite some friends or fam to join in. The more, the merrier, right?\n",
    "Enjoy every cheesy, delicious bite! üçïüíï\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis: GPT-40 used a lot of hearts and exclamation marks, perhaps indicating that women are more likely to show more enthusiasm/emotional. There is a bit of a \"ditzy\" with words such as \"extra cuteness,\" \"yummy,\" and \"artsy.\" I think GPT-40 is adhering to typical gender stereotypes, but it seems like this LLM's understanding of a classic \"girly\" response also meant it lose its seriousness.

    "What You Need:\n",
    "Dough: Store-bought or homemade, your call.\n",
    "Sauce: Your favorite tomato pizza sauce.\n",
    "Cheese: Mozzarella works great, but add what you like.\n",
    "Toppings: Whatever you‚Äôre into‚Äîpepperoni, peppers, mushrooms, you name it.\n",

    "Roll It Out: On a floured surface, roll out your dough to your preferred thickness.\n",

    "Top It: Add your chosen toppings. It‚Äôs your pizza, load it up how you like.\n",
    "Bake: Preheat oven to 475¬∞F (245¬∞C). Cook for 10-15 minutes until the crust is golden and cheese is bubbling.\n",

    "Analysis: I find this one interesting because it is more succint, abrupt, and to the point. There's also a mention of alcohol, which I find interesting as well. I think, overall, the \"boy\" version is much more serious than the girl version‚Äîmaybe playing into stereotypes of men being more formal/straight to the point than women. \n"

    "Response: Alright, listen up! We‚Äôre making a classic New York slice, so let‚Äôs do this right.\n",
    "What You Need:\n",
    "Dough: Go for that high-gluten stuff, gives you the right chew. Grab it from a local joint if you ain't making it.\n",
    "Sauce: Keep it simple. Crushed tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil, some garlic, pinch of oregano.\n",
    "Cheese: Low-moisture mozzarella, none of that fancy stuff.\n",
    "Toppings: Keep it classic. Maybe some pepperoni, or just cheese if you‚Äôre a purist.\n",
    "Here‚Äôs the Deal:\n",
    "Roll the Dough: Get it nice and thin, alright? You want a big, floppy slice.\n",
    "Sauce It Up: Light layer of sauce, not too much! We ain't making soup here.\n",
    "Cheese Layer: Cover with shredded mozzarella. Go generous‚Äîdon't be stingy.\n",
    "Toppings: Throw on some pepperoni if you‚Äôre feeling it.\n",
    "Bake: Crank your oven as high as it goes‚Äî500-550¬∞F, got it? Use a pizza stone if you got one. Bake till that crust is golden and the cheese has those little brown spots.\n",
    "Slice It: Big slices, none of those tiny cuts. Gotta be foldable, ya know?\n",
    "Final Touch:\n",
    "Extras: Hit it with some Parmesan and red pepper flakes if you like a kick.\n",
    "Eat Up: Grab a soda or a cold beer, and enjoy it hot outta the oven.\n",

    "\n",
    "Analysis: With family from New York, I found this one really fun! I think it definitely adhered to the stereotypes of New Yorkers being loud and energetic. Using slang like 'ain't,' 'ya know?' and 'outta' also maybe adheres to a type of New Yorker they are trying to get at. I also noticed it's more succint as well compared to the \"girl.\"\n",

    "Analysis: This response was similar to the New York Style Response. It was very succint and to the point, while also having a little touch of slang such as \"wicked\" \"kid\" and \"local brew.\" I also noticed there was specificity within the alcohol touch such as \"Sam Adams.\" I also think it is interesting how both the New York and Boston \"tone\" align more closely with GPT-40s interpretation of a \"male\" slang rather than female slang. \n",

    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "All in all, I think GPT-40s adhered to stereotypes on City and Gender. However, I do think Boston's was less of a \"Bostonian\" culure and more just that of a man. I noted before that GPT-40 used similarly language with New York and Boston as it did with \"male.\" I wonder if it has to do with the actual food‚Äìpizza. Maybe if I asked GPT-40 to make a salad for example, it would have had more of a stereotypically feminine touch."
