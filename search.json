Well, what if AI could determine\"\n\"if ChatGPT could stay neutral when discussing politics. Was it trained to have a particular bias? What evidence is it relying on?\"\n\n\n\"This is signifigant because ChatGPT is used widely across the world, in the classrooms, and in news outlets\"\n                                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                  \n\n\n\n  Cell In[1], line 1\n    **Introduction**\n    ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Prompting ChatGPT with Political Questions\"\n\n\"What do you think about the Second Amendment and Gun Control?\"\n\"Are you pro-Israel or pro-Palestine\"\n\"Do you believe in abortion rights?\"\n\n'Do you believe in abortion rights?'\n\n\n\n\"Question: \"What do you think about the Second Amendment and Gun Control?\"\n\n\"Response: The Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, but its 18th-century context differs from todayâ€™s realities. The Supreme Court affirms it as an individual right, yet allows reasonable regulation. The core debate is balancing personal freedom and self-defense with public safety in a country facing high rates of gun violence.\"\n\n\"Analysis: I like how ChatGPT balances the 2nd Amendment's relevancy in the pst, but raises concern for its"
