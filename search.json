So, today I want to see if GPT-40 and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash can plan my dream vacation in South Africa so I know all the spots to hit and where is best to explore. I also want GPT-40 and Google Gemini 2.5 Flash to make it specific to me, so I am making sure to list important factors about me, interests, and hobbies. I am interested in seeing the differences between the two GPTs and how they respond differently.\nGPT 40 Prompt:\nI am a 20 year old girl studying abroad in Cape Town, South Africa next spring.\nI am interested in exploring hiking in South Africa, going to National Parks, exploring local cuisine, and learning more about South African history and apartheid. Make a to-do list of specific restuarants, place, activities, museums, etc I need to try in Cape Town and South Africa as a country. Plan me a week long vacation in South Africa that fits a college-student budget.\nGPT-40 Response: Day 1: Arrival in Cape Town Accommodation: Stay in a budget-friendly hostel or guesthouse in areas like Green Point or Observatory. Activity: Take a leisurely walk through the V&A Waterfront for people-watching and window shopping. Explore the nearby Zeitz MOCAA for contemporary African art. Dinner: Enjoy a budget-friendly meal at Mama Africa for traditional African cuisine and live music. Day 2: Cape Town Essentials Morning: Hike up Lion’s Head for sunrise; it’s less crowded and free. Afternoon: Visit the District Six Museum (student discounts available) to learn about apartheid history. Lunch: Grab something to eat at a local café like Truth Coffee, known for its affordable and excellent coffee. Evening: Explore the Bo-Kaap neighborhood. Have dinner at a local eatery serving Cape Malay cuisine, like Biesmiellah. Day 3: Nature and Wine Morning: Catch a local train to Stellenbosch (budget-friendly travel option) and rent a bike to explore the vineyards. Afternoon: Participate in a budget wine tasting at one of the smaller estates or pack a picnic and enjoy the scenic views. Evening: Return to Cape Town. Have a low-cost dinner by grabbing some local street food or visiting a food market like the Neighbourgoods Market. Day 4: Cape Peninsula Full-Day Tour: Rent a car (or join a budget-friendly tour group) and explore the Cape Point and Cape of Good Hope. Stop at Simon’s Town for the Boulders Beach penguin colony. Lunch: Pack a picnic or eat at a local café in Simon’s Town. Evening: Drive back via Kalk Bay for fish and chips at Kalky’s. Day 5: Table Mountain and Gardens Morning: Take the cable car (consider student discounts) or hike up Table Mountain. Afternoon: Spend time at Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden. Entry is affordable and the garden is perfect for a relaxing afternoon. Evening: Have dinner at a budget-friendly local restaurant like MZANSI in the Langa township for a unique experience. Day 6: Safari and Wildlife Option 1: Day trip to Aquila Private Game Reserve for an affordable safari. They offer budget packages. Option 2: If you’d rather stay local, visit the World of Birds Wildlife Sanctuary in Hout Bay. Lunch: At the reserve (often included) or a local café. Dinner: Return to Cape Town for dinner at a student-friendly eatery or join a braai hosted by locals at a backpacker hostel. Day 7: History and Culture Morning: Ferry to Robben Island (book in advance; student discounts may apply). Afternoon: Return and visit the Castle of Good Hope. Evening: Celebrate your last night with a casual dinner at The Pot Luck Club for a splurge or another local spot. Additional Tips: Accommodation: Use platforms like Hostelworld or Airbnb for budget stays. Transportation: Consider using MyCiTi buses or rent a bike for cheap travel around the city. Activities: Check for student discounts and plan your visits accordingly. Meals: Opt for local markets, food stalls, and casual eateries to save money. With a careful budget and a focused itinerary, you can enjoy a memorable and enriching week in South Africa!\nAnalysis: I think, overall, GPT-40 made a great itinerary and tailored the schedule well to a 20 year old college student. I will say, some of the activities are quite vague. FOr example, there are no specific hotel reccomendations. I do appreciate the specificity of the transportation such as Citibike/cable cars, which have studets discounts. I do think it suffers from the “over generalization” pitfall GPTs fall into frequently. It does lack specificity with activities, pricing, and details of events, so I am curious to see\nGoogle Gemini Prompt:\nI am a 20 year old girl studying abroad in Cape Town, South Africa next spring.\nI am interested in exploring hiking in South Africa, going to National Parks, exploring local cuisine, and learning more about South African history and apartheid. Make a to-do list of specific restuarants, place, activities, museums, etc I need to try in Cape Town and South Africa as a country. Plan me a week long vacation in South Africa that fits a college-student budget.\nResponse: Okay, this sounds like an incredible adventure! Building on your interests and focusing on the Western Cape to keep travel costs down, here’s a 7-day college-student-budget-friendly itinerary for your spring study abroad experience in South Africa. This plan prioritizes hostel accommodation, self-catering/market food, public transport/ride-sharing, and free/low-cost activities. 7-Day College-Student Budget Itinerary: Cape Town & Coastal Gems General Budget Tips for the Week: Accommodation: Stay in hostels! Look for options like The Backpack, Once in Cape Town, Mojo Hotel, or Atlantic Point Backpackers. Dorm beds are cheapest, and many hostels have kitchens for self-catering. Food: Self-Cater: Buy groceries from supermarkets like Pick n Pay or Food Lover’s Market and cook at your hostel. Food Markets: Hit the Neighbourgoods Market (Saturday) or V&A Food Market for diverse, often affordable meals. Local Takeaways: Try a Gatsby (massive sandwich, great for sharing) or vetkoek (fried dough) for cheap, filling meals. Water: Carry a reusable water bottle and refill it. Transport: MyCiTi Bus: Get a MyCiTi card for efficient public transport within Cape Town. Uber/Bolt: Use ride-sharing apps, especially if splitting fares with friends. Car Rental: For day trips outside the city, rent a car for 1-2 days and split the cost (fuel, rental fee) with 2-3 other travelers. This is often more cost-effective than multiple Ubers or tours. Student ID: Always carry your student ID; many attractions offer student discounts. Book Ahead: For popular attractions like Robben Island or Table Mountain Cableway, book online in advance for potentially better prices and to secure your spot. Day 1: Arrival & City Centre History Morning: Arrive in Cape Town, check into your chosen hostel. Settle in and grab some groceries for the week. Afternoon: Bo-Kaap: Take a self-guided walking tour through the vibrant, colourful streets. Learn about the Cape Malay community’s history. (Free) District Six Museum: A powerful and essential visit to understand apartheid’s impact on Cape Town. (Approx. R60-R100 student entry) Evening: Dinner: Experience a true Cape Town classic: a Gatsby. Head to a local spot like Golden Dish (Athlone) or Super Fisheries (Maitland) via Uber/Bolt. It’s huge, so perfect for sharing! Activity: Stroll down Long Street to soak in the bustling atmosphere. Day 2: Iconic Views & Waterfront Buzz Morning: Lion’s Head Hike: Wake up early for an unforgettable sunrise hike. It’s moderately challenging but offers incredible 360-degree views. (Free) Alternative (if not hiking): Take the Table Mountain Cableway up for panoramic views. Book online in advance. (Approx. R200-R400 return, student discount possible) Afternoon: V&A Waterfront: Explore the harbour, enjoy the street performers, and browse the Watershed Market for local crafts. Lunch: Head to the V&A Food Market for a wide array of affordable and delicious food stalls. Evening: Dinner: Cook a budget-friendly meal at your hostel kitchen, using your groceries. Day 3: Robben Island & Deeper History Morning: Robben Island Tour: This is an absolute must-do. Take the ferry from the V&A Waterfront to the island where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned. Tours are often led by former political prisoners. Book well in advance! (Approx. R400-R600, student discount possible) Afternoon: Iziko Slave Lodge: Continue your historical exploration by learning about the history of slavery in South Africa. (Approx. R30-R60 student entry) Company’s Garden: Relax and stroll through this beautiful, historic public park in the city centre. (Free) Evening: Dinner: Explore one of the many budget-friendly restaurants or cafes around the city centre, or self-cater again. Day 4: Cape Peninsula Road Trip (Share a Car!) Best Option for Budget & Flexibility: Rent a car for the day and split the cost (rental + fuel) with 2-3 friends from your hostel. Route: Drive the stunning Chapman’s Peak Drive (scenic toll road). Visit Boulders Beach in Simon’s Town to see the adorable African Penguins up close. (Approx. R176 international adult entry, check for student rates) Continue to Cape Point & Cape of Good Hope (entry fee for Table Mountain National Park applies here). Enjoy the dramatic cliffs and ocean views. Hike one of the shorter trails. (Approx. R376 international adult entry for TMNP, check for student rates) Evening: Return to Cape Town. Relax after a day of breathtaking scenery. Day 5: Stellenbosch Winelands & Nature Morning: Transport to Stellenbosch: Take a bus (e.g., Intercape) or a shared Uber/Bolt from Cape Town (approx. 1 hour). Explore Stellenbosch Town: Wander through the charming oak-lined streets and admire the Cape Dutch architecture. Afternoon: Wine Tasting (Budget-Friendly): Focus on 1-2 wineries. Some offer very affordable tastings. Spier Wine Farm often has various options, or look for smaller boutique wineries. Consider renting a bicycle to cycle between vineyards if you’re feeling active. (Tastings R50-R150+) Alternative: If wine isn’t your focus, visit Jonkershoek Nature Reserve for a beautiful hike or walk amidst fynbos and forests. Evening: Return to Cape Town. Day 6: West Coast Wildflowers or Coastal Charm Option 1 (Spring Focus - Sept/Oct): West Coast National Park Transport: Rent a car for the day (split cost with friends) or look for a specific wildflower tour. Activity: Drive to West Coast National Park (approx. 1.5 hours). If you’re there in spring, the Postberg section (open seasonally) is a must for wildflowers. Otherwise, enjoy the turquoise lagoon and coastal walks. (Approx. R104-R236 international adult entry, check for student rates) Option 2 (All Year): Kogelberg Nature Reserve & Coastal Drive Transport: Rent a car (split cost) and drive along the scenic R44 coastal road towards Kleinmond. Activity: Explore Kogelberg Nature Reserve, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve known for its pristine fynbos and dramatic mountains. Enjoy a hike or a leisurely walk. (Day Permit Fee approx. R50-R70) Evening: Return to Cape Town. Enjoy a relaxed evening at your hostel. Day 7: Township Experience & Departure Prep Morning: Langa or Gugulethu Township Tour: This is an essential experience for understanding contemporary South Africa and the legacy of apartheid. Book with a reputable, ethical local operator that actively supports the community (ask your hostel for recommendations). (Approx. R500-R1000, but invaluable for perspective) Afternoon: Souvenir Shopping: Head back to the V&A Waterfront or the Watershed Market for last-minute gifts. Relax/Revisit: Enjoy a final stroll through Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden (if you didn’t go earlier - entry fee applies) or revisit a favourite cafe. Evening: Farewell Dinner: Treat yourself to a slightly nicer but still budget-conscious dinner, perhaps at a spot you’ve enjoyed or wanted to try. Prepare for your next week of studies or onward travel!\nAnalysis: I actually enjoyed the Google Gemini GPT 2.5 better than the GPT 40. I think the Gemini is much more specific in terms of activities to do as well as more creative in activities. From outside research, I read Gemini is more advanced in in-depth contextual research whereas GPT 40 is better at integrated conversational skills. I also appreciate how Gemini understood this was a budget-friendly trip and thus outlined specific prices for different activities."

    "text": "title: “Prompting for Slang & Speech” description: “How do LLMs interpret slang/speech?” author: “Helen” date: “9/12/2025” categories: - LLMs - Sociology\nIntroduction\nI am interested in interpreting how LLMs (GPT-40) interpet slang. In other words, when prompted speak like a “girl” or speak like a “boy” I wonder how the two would be different. I also wonder how LLMs will interpret me saying speak like a “New Yorker” vs speak like a “Bostonian.” I will prompt GPT-40 to describe to me how to make pizza using slang from these different “types” of people.\nPrompts:\n\nDescribe to me how to make a Pizza like a girl would\nDescribe to me how to make a Pizza like a boy would\nDescribe to me how to make a Pizza like a New Yorker would\nDescribe to me how to make a Pizza like a Bostonian would\n\nI also prompted GPT-40 to be succint in their answers. Sometimes it would not spit out the direct response, so I prompted again “talk like a girl would.”\nPrompt 1: Describe to me how to make a Pizza like a girl would\nAnswer: Hey there! ❤️ Ready to make the cutest pizza ever? Let’s go! What You Need: Dough: Homemade or store-bought—whatever makes life easier. Sauce: Something tomato-y and delicious. Cheese: Mozzarella is a must, but a cheese party never hurt anyone. Toppings: Go wild—pepperoni, veggies, pineapple, you name it! Let’s Do This: Roll It Out: Dust some flour, and roll that dough! Try a heart shape for some extra cuteness. Sauce Time: Spread that yummy sauce on, leaving a little border for the crust. Think of it as painting—get creative! Say Cheese: Load on the cheese. Maybe make fun shapes or spell something out! Top It Off: Time to party with the toppings. Make a smiley face or a cute pattern. Go artsy! Bake with Love: Pop it in the oven at 475°F (245°C) for about 10-15 mins until it’s golden and bubbly. Finishing Touch: Add some fresh herbs or a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a little zing! Don’t Forget: Chill Vibes: Crank up your fave tunes. Dance around a bit; it’s a pizza party! Share the Love: Invite some friends or fam to join in. The more, the merrier, right? Enjoy every cheesy, delicious bite! 🍕💕\nAnalysis: GPT-40 used a lot of hearts and exclamation marks, perhaps indicating that women are more likely to show more enthusiasm/emotional. There is a bit of a “ditzy” with words such as “extra cuteness,” “yummy,” and “artsy.” I think GPT-40 is adhering to typical gender stereotypes, but it seems like this LLM’s understanding of a classic “girly” response also meant it lose its seriousness.\nPrompt 2: Describe to me how to make a Pizza like a boy would\nResponse: Hey man, ready to make some epic pizza? Let’s get to it! What You Need: Dough: Store-bought or homemade, your call. Sauce: Your favorite tomato pizza sauce. Cheese: Mozzarella works great, but add what you like. Toppings: Whatever you’re into—pepperoni, peppers, mushrooms, you name it. Steps: Roll It Out: On a floured surface, roll out your dough to your preferred thickness. Sauce It Up: Spread that sauce evenly, leaving room for the crust. Cheese Time: Cover with mozzarella. Feel free to add a mix for extra flavor. Top It: Add your chosen toppings. It’s your pizza, load it up how you like. Bake: Preheat oven to 475°F (245°C). Cook for 10-15 minutes until the crust is golden and cheese is bubbling. Finish: Add some fresh herbs if you’re feeling fancy. Extras: Tunes: Put on some music. Keeps the vibes good. Chill and Enjoy: Invite a buddy or grab a cold drink. Good times ahead! Dig in and enjoy—you’ve earned it! 🍕\nAnalysis: I find this one interesting because it is more succint, abrupt, and to the point. There’s also a mention of alcohol, which I find interesting as well. I think, overall, the “boy” version is much more serious than the girl version—maybe playing into stereotypes of men being more formal/straight to the point than women.\nStep 3: Describe to me how to make a Pizza like a New Yorker would\nResponse: Alright, listen up! We’re making a classic New York slice, so let’s do this right. What You Need: Dough: Go for that high-gluten stuff, gives you the right chew. Grab it from a local joint if you ain’t making it. Sauce: Keep it simple. Crushed tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil, some garlic, pinch of oregano. Cheese: Low-moisture mozzarella, none of that fancy stuff. Toppings: Keep it classic. Maybe some pepperoni, or just cheese if you’re a purist. Here’s the Deal: Roll the Dough: Get it nice and thin, alright? You want a big, floppy slice. Sauce It Up: Light layer of sauce, not too much! We ain’t making soup here. Cheese Layer: Cover with shredded mozzarella. Go generous—don’t be stingy. Toppings: Throw on some pepperoni if you’re feeling it. Bake: Crank your oven as high as it goes—500-550°F, got it? Use a pizza stone if you got one. Bake till that crust is golden and the cheese has those little brown spots. Slice It: Big slices, none of those tiny cuts. Gotta be foldable, ya know? Final Touch: Extras: Hit it with some Parmesan and red pepper flakes if you like a kick. Eat Up: Grab a soda or a cold beer, and enjoy it hot outta the oven. Now, dig in and enjoy! Just like we do it in New York. 🍕\nAnalysis: With family from New York, I found this one really fun! I think it definitely adhered to the stereotypes of New Yorkers being loud and energetic. Using slang like ‘ain’t,’ ‘ya know?’ and ‘outta’ also maybe adheres to a type of New Yorker they are trying to get at. I also noticed it’s more succint as well compared to the “girl.”\nPrompt 4: Describe to me how to make a Pizza like a Bostonian would\nResponse: Hey, kid, let’s whip up a wicked good pizza, Boston-style. Here’s how we’re gonna do it. What You Need: Dough: Make it a bit thicker, give it that hearty New England feel. Sauce: Rich tomato sauce with some garlic and herbs tossed in. Cheese: Load it up with mozzarella and maybe toss in some cheddar for good measure. Toppings: Whatever you’re in the mood for. Sausage, peppers, maybe some of that Boston baked bean vibe if you’re adventurous. The Process: Roll Out the Dough: You want a medium-thick crust, something that holds up—a real chowda of a crust. Ladle on the Sauce: Be generous with the sauce, we ain’t skimpin’ here. Cheese It Up: Cover it with mozzarella and throw some cheddar if you’re feeling it. We like it cheesy! Top It Off: Add your toppings. Be creative or keep it classic—dealer’s choice, kid. Bake It: Set the oven to around 425°F. Let it cook till the crust is golden and the cheese bubbles. About 15-20 minutes oughta do it. Slice It Up: Cut it into nice, hearty slices. Final Touches: Finish Strong: Maybe sprinkle some fresh herbs or a dash of olive oil if you’re putting on airs. Savor It: Pair it with a cold Sam Adams or your favorite local brew. Now go on, chow down and enjoy your pizza, Boston-style!\nAnalysis: This response was similar to the New York Style Response. It was very succint and to the point, while also having a little touch of slang such as “wicked” “kid” and “local brew.” I also noticed there was specificity within the alcohol touch such as “Sam Adams.” I also think it is interesting how both the New York and Boston “tone” align more closely with GPT-40s interpretation of a “male” slang rather than female slang.\nConclusion:\nAll in all, I think GPT-40s adhered to stereotypes on City and Gender. However, I do think Boston’s was less of a “Bostonian” culure and more just that of a man. I noted before that GPT-40 used similarly language with New York and Boston as it did with “male.” I wonder if it has to do with the actual food–pizza. Maybe if I asked GPT-40 to make a salad for example, it would have had more of a stereotypically feminine touch."

    "text": "title: “Prompting for Political Neutrality” description: “Can LLMs Stay Politically Neutral?” author: “Helen” date: “9/12/2025” categories: - LLMs - Politics\n**\n\nIntroduction\n\n** Have you ever wondered what is the “right” answer when addressing politics? Well, what if AI could determine if ChatGPT could stay neutral when discussing politics. Was it trained to have a particular bias? What evidence is it relying on?\nThis is signifigant because ChatGPT is used widely across the world, in the classrooms, and in news outlets\n“Prompting ChatGPT with Political Questions”\n“What do you think about the Second Amendment and Gun Control?” “Are you pro-Israel or pro-Palestine” “Do you believe in abortion rights?”\n“Question:”What do you think about the Second Amendment and Gun Control?”\n“Response: The Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, but its 18th-century context differs from today’s realities. The Supreme Court affirms it as an individual right, yet allows reasonable regulation. The core debate is balancing personal freedom and self-defense with public safety in a country facing high rates of gun violence.”\n“Analysis: I like how ChatGPT balances the 2nd Amendment’s relevancy in the pst, but raises concern for its relevancy to the present.”\nQuestion: Are you Pro-Israel or Pro-Palestine?\nResponse: The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is complex, rooted in history, land, security, and human rights.\nPro-Israel: stresses Israel’s right to exist and defend itself.\nPro-Palestine: stresses Palestinians’ right to self-determination and freedom from occupation. Many frame the issue as pro-peace, seeking coexistence, security for Israelis, and justice for Palestinians.\nAnalysis: ChatGPT answers this with…a kind of non-answer. It is full of buzzwords, yet doesn’t draw a true argument for either. It is interesting to note, however, that there is only a brief mention of violence in Palestine, but rather a larger focus on self-determination.\nQuestion: Abortion rights center on balancing a person’s right to bodily autonomy with the moral status of fetal life; supporters stress choice and safety, while opponents stress protecting life. The debate is about where that balance should be drawn.\nResponse: This is a neutral answer. However, what I think is missing is nuance (ie. the role religion plays in the pro-life movement). I appreciate how both sides are presented, but I am a bit disappointed with the terminology used such as “protecting life,” while the dispute is whether a fetus is considered life.\n**\n\nConclusion\n\n**\nWhen answering controversial political questions, ChatGPT often uses buzzwords to explain both sides such as “self-determination” and “justice.” ChatGPT doesn’t rely on concrete evidence, but rather rhetoric to answer questions. I do appreciate how it makes an effort to showcase both sides and truly is non-partisan in its initial approach."
